# Project 3: Around The U.S. 
  
**Intro**
  
This application allows users to upload photos with custom captions to a personal photo collection. Users may also create a custom profile. I built modals windows and unique client-side form validation behavior to improve the user's experience. 
  
**Technologies and Techniques Used**  
  
*The Web Application is built using the following techniques:

JavaScript: An object-oriented language used to create some interactive pieces on my project. 
HTML5: Markup language used for structuring the web pages.
CSS3: Styling language used for designing the visual layout of the application.
  
**Project Features**  
  
The key features at the moment of the Photo Gallery include:

Interactive Photo Cards: Users can browse through a collection of photo cards, each representing a unique photo.  They can also like the photo, delete the photo card, edit the photo card as they wish. 

**Github**

The live version of the Photo Gallery Web Application can be accessed on GitHub Pages here:

**Validation**

To ensure the code's integrity and validity, the following steps have been taken:

1. The HTML and CSS code have been thoroughly checked for typos and errors.
2. The code has been validated using the W3C Markup Validator to ensure compliance with HTML standards.
3. Prettier, a code formatter, has been used to ensure consistent and well-formatted code.
